# RISC-V-ISA-Cache-Simulator

This project was completed during my first year in the Computer Architecture course. It focuses on RISC-V cache simulation, translating C code into RISC-V assembly, modeling cache work with LRU and bit-pLRU eviction policies, and converting assembly to machine code.

Key features:

- RISC-V assembly translation following the RV32I and RV32M instruction sets.
  
- Cache system simulation with configurable eviction policies (LRU & pLRU).

- Assembly-to-machine code conversion with detailed instruction encoding.

- Performance evaluation using hit rate metrics.
  
This repository showcases my work on processor and cache architecture, demonstrating expertise in C++, low-level programming, and cache optimization.

The program simulates the operation of a processor and cache with a look-through write-back policy and LRU and pLRU replacement policies while executing assembly code.
